# jmap-client-ts

A [Jmap](https://jmap.io/spec.html) Client written in Typescript.

## How to use it

Import in in your project (in you `package.json`), you can reference a commit or a branch to use snapshot versions.

Create the client
```typescript
let client = new Client({
    accessToken: 'myToken',
    sessionUrl: 'http://jmap.example.com/session,
});
```

Fetch the session, it will return a promise (of void), the result will be stored on the client and can be accesed later with `getSession()`
```typescript
client.fetchSession();
```

When the `fetchSession()` promise resolves, you can make requests, the name of the method corresponds to the names in the specs, with lowerCamelCase, and the `/` replaced by a `_`, it will return a promise.
```typescript
client.mailbox_get({
    accountId: Object.keys(jmapClient.getSession().accounts)[0],
    ids: null,
})
```

Push (web sockets) usage example for mailboxes
```typescript
const mailboxObservable = client.pushMailbox().subscribe();
client.pushStart();
```
Client can also be started before subscribing to `pushMailbox` observable.
